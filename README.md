# Neuroscience Experiments and Simulations

This repository contains a collection of neuroscience-related projects and code notebooks. Each project is designed to explore key concepts in cognitive or computational neuroscience using simulation, data analysis, or machine learning.

## Contents

- **1. Predictive Coding Simulation**  
  A simple model demonstrating how a predictive system can learn to minimize sensory prediction error over time.

- _(Add future projects to come soon)_

## Goals

- Develop intuitive and computational understanding of brain function
- Explore neural and cognitive theories through simulation
- Practice working with real or simulated neuroscience data

## Tools

- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn)
- Google Colab or Jupyter notebooks
